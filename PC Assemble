In this PC Assemble Lab, I learned how to assemble and disassemble the PC by following the instructions given.

These steps are:

  Open the case
  Disconnect all the connected wires.
  Remove the power supply
  Remove off the RAM
  Remove the Hard Disk
  Remove the CPU fan
To reassemble the PC, just repeat the steps inversely.
Besides that,i had learned the component of PC, such as Cover,Cable,Power supply, RAM,Hard disk and CPU fan
